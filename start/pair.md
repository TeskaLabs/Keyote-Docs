Keyote Pairing
====================

After you’ve [installed](install) both the Keyote mobile app and the Keyote desktop app, it’s time to pair the Keyote mobile app with your computer.  
For a best pairing experience, make sure that your mobile phone and a computer with Keyote are on the same Wi-Fi network,
and Keyote application is started on both of them.

The pairing process is started on the mobile phone, go to "Pairings" tab and press "Add pairing" button:
