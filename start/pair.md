Keyote Pairing
====================

After you’ve [installed](install) both the Keyote mobile app and the Keyote desktop app, it’s time to pair the Keyote mobile app with your computer.  
For a best pairing experience, make sure that your mobile phone and a computer with Keyote are on the same Wi-Fi network,
and Keyote application is started on both of them.

Start the pairing process on the mobile phone:


<div class="container mt-5">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
			<hr />
			<a href="use">
				Continue to usage
			</a>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
