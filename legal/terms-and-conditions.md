# Terms and Conditions

Last updated: March 23, 2019 

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Keyote application (the "Service") operated by TeskaLabs Ltd ("us", "we", or "our"). 

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. 

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service. 


## Subscriptions 

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. 

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or TeskaLabs Ltd cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting TeskaLabs Ltd customer support team. 

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide TeskaLabs Ltd with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize TeskaLabs Ltd to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. 

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, TeskaLabs Ltd will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice. 


## Free Trial 

TeskaLabs Ltd may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). 

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. 
If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by TeskaLabs Ltd until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected. 

At any time and without notice, TeskaLabs Ltd reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer. 


## Fee Changes 

TeskaLabs Ltd, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. 
TeskaLabs Ltd will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. 

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount. 


## Refunds 

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by TeskaLabs Ltd on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of TeskaLabs Ltd. 


## Termination 

We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. 

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service. 

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. 


## Indemnification 

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless TeskaLabs Ltd and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password, or b) a breach of these Terms. 


## Limitation Of Liability 

In no event shall TeskaLabs Ltd, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. 


## Disclaimer 

Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.

## Exclusions 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding any other provision of these terms, under no circumstances will TeskaLabs Ltd ever be liable to you or any other person for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary loss or damage arising from, connected with, or relating to your use of the Service, these Terms, the subject matter of these Terms, the termination of these Terms or otherwise, including but not limited to personal injury, loss of data, business, markets, savings, income, profits, use, production, reputation or goodwill, anticipated or otherwise, or economic loss, under any theory of liability (whether in contract, tort, strict liability or any other theory or law or equity), regardless of any negligence or other fault or wrongdoing (including without limitation gross negligence and fundamental breach) by TeskaLabs Ltd or any person for whom TeskaLabs Ltd is responsible, and even if TeskaLabs Ltd has been advised of the possibility of such loss or damage being incurred. 


## Governing Law 

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. 

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service. 


## Changes 

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. 

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the service.
